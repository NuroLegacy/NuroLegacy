Complete CCNA 200-300 Course Notes
This is my repository of my personal notes taken during Jeremy's IT Lab Complete CCNA 200-300 course. Each "Day" is broken down into individual chapters.

Jeremy's IT Lab Complete Course for the CCNA 200-300

I've also created a separate custom YouTube Playlist of just the Course Labs for easy access.

I also highly recommend his second set of older labs for practice during, and after, finishing the course, for review.
